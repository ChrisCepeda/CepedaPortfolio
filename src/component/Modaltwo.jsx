              <h4> üóÇÔ∏è PROJECT OVERVIEW</h4>
                <p>In this project the team was assigned to do a real B2B product. The client 
                  Doc Lounge specialises in documentary film distribution of new Nordic and 
                  international documentaries through events and outreach. They continuously work with development 
                  projects to innovate documentary distribution and the film screening experience.
                  The project was developed through the User Centered Design process 
                  with four phases: discover, define, develop and deliver. This iterative process 
                  made us discover and understand the context of use, then define the user requirements, 
                  develop solutions and finally deliver against the requirements. 
                </p>
